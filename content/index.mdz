## Overview

Mendoza is a static site generator. It is a thin wrapper around the Janet programming language
for templating HTML, writing Markup, and developing a static website. The template and markup
languages are both Janet DSLs, or dialects, so can used ordinary Janet functions, macros, and modules.

With inspiration from @link[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/]{Scribble},
we are using a macro system which expands the entire document into a Janet data structure, and
then calls @code[eval] on that data structure to generate a document. That document is then
rendered into HTML, with each node having an optional template. This design is flexible enough
to let us dictate form from the markup (via janet functions and macros) and from the templates
(templates can wrap nodes in HTML, and even call other janet functions to render markup in
arbitrary ways. HTML, however, remains the sole intended output format.

## Simple Example

It should be easy to get a basic site up and running in Mendoza, as there are no configuration
files required and templates are provided out of the box (in the example to follow, we make
use of the "blueblog" template).

Below is an equivalent of "Hello, World!" for mendoza. From within your project directory,
put the content into a file named @code`content/index.mdz`
and run @code`mdz` from the project directory to generate your site.

@codeblock```
{:title "Hello, world!"
 :template "blueblog/main.html"
 :author "me@myself.net"}
---
# Hey there!

Welcome to my site!
```

## Serving the Site

Once your site has been generated, the output artifacts will be in the @code`site` directory.
You can view them directly by pointing your browser to the @code`site/index.html` file.
Alternatively, you can serve them using your favorite HTTP server or else run @code`mdz serve`
to serve them on the local machine using @link[https://github.com/janet-lang/circlet]{circlet}.

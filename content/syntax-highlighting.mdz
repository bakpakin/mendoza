# Syntax Highlighting

Mendoza supports syntax highlighting for a few languages out of the box, and also has a simple mechanism for adding more
languages. Built in grammars include @link[https://janet-lang.org]{Janet}, C, and HTML.

## Simple Example

Syntax highlighting occurs in @code{\@codeblock} blocks. For example, the following markup will do syntax highlighting for some Janet source code.

@codeblock````
@codeblock[janet]```
(def a (+ 1 2))
```
````

Produces:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def a (+ 1 2))
```

## Adding More Grammars

To add more grammars, you will need to add
a Janet source file in the @code{syntax/} folder of your
source. Mendoza will automatically load syntaxes on demand
if you reference them in your content files.

The built-in grammars are probably a good starting point if you
would like highlighting for a language that is not yet supported.
Alternatively, you can raise an issue on @link[https://github.com/bakpakin/mendoza/]{GitHub} for more built-in grammars.

# Static Content

Most static sites will want to included resources like images, CSS, javascript, or
plain HTML that is not processed in any way for the final static website. Mendoza
supports static content byte copying files from the @code`static/` directory of your code
into the output @code`site/` directory when you build the website. Directory structure
will be preserved as well.
